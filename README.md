Project started while following Udemy course : "Make Online Games Using Unity's NEW Multiplayer Framework" **by GameDev.tv Team & Nathan Farrer (aka Dapper Dino)**

Link to the course : https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-multiplayer-netcode/

I just wanted to learn Netcode for GameObjects and wanted to improve my understanding of high level networking API.
